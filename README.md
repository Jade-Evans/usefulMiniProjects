ðŸ›’ shoppingList
Basic DOM-based shopping list app with dynamic item handling. Focused on JavaScript fundamentals, event listeners, and clean UI structure.
Things to Practice / Remember
- focus() method: used to return cursor to input field after adding an itemâ€”new to me and useful for improving UX.
- while (list.firstChild): used to remove all list items efficientlyâ€”reinforced loop logic and DOM traversal.
- DOM manipulation: practiced creating, appending, and removing elements dynamically.
- Event handling: added listeners for form submission and button clicks to trigger updates.
Ideas for Improvement
- Add basic styling for visual clarity and polish.
- Include animations for item addition/removal to enhance UX.
- Extend functionality to create a to-do list or categorized items.
- Refactor code for readability and modularity.
